## Project Goals

1. Develop a scalable LMS to simplify educational administration.
2. Provide role-based access for users, such as administrators, teachers, and students.
3. Enable efficient course and resource management through modern web technologies.

## Database Schema

The application includes (among others) the following entities in its database:
1. **Users**: Stores user details, including role distinctions (Admin, Teacher, Student).

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **C# .NET Core**: For the RESTful API and backend logic.
- **Entity Framework**: ORM for database interactions.

### Frontend
- **React**: For building the dynamic UI.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for modern web applications.

### Database
- **SQL Server**: Used for data persistence.

### Development Tools
- **Visual Studio**: Preferred IDE for backend development.
- **VS Code**: IDE for frontend development.

3. **Open the solution**:
   Open `LMS.sln` in Visual Studio.

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` within the `LMS.API` project.
   - Apply migrations to create the database schema:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

5. **Run the server**:
   - Press `F5` in Visual Studio or execute:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

### Frontend (Client)

1. **Navigate to the client directory**:
    ```bash
    cd LMS/Client
    ```

2. **Switch branches (if needed)**:
    ```bash
    git checkout test
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:
